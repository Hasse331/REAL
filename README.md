This projects is 100% made by me. There would be still very much to do, especially refactoring, security improvements, optimizations, finishing some features and much more. Anyways, I'm not continuing this project anymore, since I have plans to make REAL v2 with new UI/UX design and technical spesifications by using flutter, go and firebase.

This project is using: 

TypeScript, Python, next.js, tailwindCSS, FastAPI, AWS RDS for postgre database & S3 for images. Jest has been used for frontend testing and there is dockerfiles and docker-compose files configured and used for running the application time to time in profuction-like environment.
